# About Me

Hey👋 , I’m **James Angwenyi** alias **Masara**  

I like figuring out how things work — and sometimes how they *don’t*.

Most days I’m exploring systems, ideas, and the internet’s weird corners, usually with a terminal open and too many tabs.

Somewhere in there, I work in cybersecurity — basically learning how things break so I can help keep them safe.

I learn by doing: break things safely, fix them, then write it down so future-me remembers.

## My Story

I learned by experimenting, asking questions, making mistakes, and digging deeper when something didn’t make sense.

I’ve worked with teams, trained others, built challenges, and investigated odd behavior.

This site is part journal, part playground, part note-to-self.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Things I’m learning (and unlearning)  
- Experiments, write-ups, and walkthroughs  
- Real-world tech notes and side projects
- Random thought too

Nothing too polished. Nothing too corporate. Just curiosity.

## How I Think

- Hands-on learning beats theory  
- Good questions matter more than fast answers  
- Documentation is underrated  

## Say Hi
